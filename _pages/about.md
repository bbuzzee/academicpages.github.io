> It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability. But, as to what probability is and how it is connected with statistics, there has seldom been such complete disagreement and breakdown of communication since the Tower of Babel." -Savage 1954

I'm Ben Buzzee. I studied math in Massachusetts, statistics in Iowa, and now I'm a Biometrician in Alaska. I'm (currently) interested in reproducible research and better understanding the statistical foundations that much of science depends on. I use the blog to try and piece together coherent pictures of statistical concepts--which is surprisingly hard to do.
