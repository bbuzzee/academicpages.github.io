Modern introductory statistics classes tend to focus exclusively on frequentist style confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. As many new (and veteran) students of statistics know, these methods can be confusing and difficult to correctly interpret. Is there a simpler, more coherent alternative? This post is an attempt to piece together a better picture of very basic statistical ideas--purely in terms of conceptual cogency.

Motivation:

 * "The reason students have problems understanding hypothesis
tests is that they may be trying to think." - The Insignificance of Statistical Significance Testing

 * "Example number one: the confidence interval. Its definition is so con-
trived and anti-intuitive that it's no wonder that students have difficulties
ingesting it." - William Briggs

 * "Claims that confidence intervals yield an
index of precision, that the values within them are plausible,
and that the confidence coefficient can be read as
a measure of certainty that the interval contains the true
value, are all fallacies and unjustified by confidence interval
theory." - The fallacy of placing confidence in confidence intervals

 * "It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability. But, as to what probability is and how it is connected with statistics, there has seldom been such complete disagreement and breakdown of communication since the Tower of Babel." Savage, 1954, pg 9


## Frequentist Methods

#### Confidence Intervals 

When the goal is to estimate the value of a parameter and get a sense of variability. 

Flaws: Interpretability, probability is about interval--not parameter, does not provide a sense of variability of the estimator

#### Hypothesis Tests 

When the goal is use an arbitrary level of "rareness under the null" to make a binary decision about a statistical hypothesis.

Flaws: Says nothing about effect size, anything can be "significant", significance level is arbitrary, fails to account for a gradient of evidence.


## Bayesian alternatives


#### Credible Intervals

#### Scratch the Tests!

## Non-Bayesian Alternatives



Logical Foundations: How does statistical evidence lead to understanding "truth" in nature? Popperian style falsification? Are hypothesis tests useful or are they misleading? "Accepting the Alternative?" A statistical procedure needs to be paired with a logical framework in order to draw conclusions about the natural world.

Statistical Evidence: P-values, effect size, likelihood ratios, posterior probabilities
