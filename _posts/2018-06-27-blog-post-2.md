Modern introductory statistics classes tend to focus exclusively on frequentist-style confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. As the field of statistics matures, many of the shortcomings of hypothesis testing have come to light, leaving the confidence interval as the preferred research tool for new and veteran practitioners of statistics alike.$^{1,2}$ Although taught in virtually every introductory statistics course in the United States, confidence intervals are widely misused and misinterpreted, even by professional scientists and statisticians. $^3$ This post attempts to clarify exactly what confidence intervals are, how to correctly interpret them, and when it makes sense to use them.


# The Problem

The need for interval estimation arises when a researcher is interested in knowing the value of an important quantity that describes an entire population (a parameter), and, for one reason or another, the entire population cannot be measured. Thus the researcher must rely on a sample to estimate the value of the parameter. The problem, then, is that different samples typically produce different estimates of the parameter of interest. The solution is to create an interval that __somehow takes into account our uncertainty in a quantifiable manner.__ What exactly quantifying uncertainty is and how to best do it is the subject of much debate.

One solution, and the one taught in virtually every introductory statistics class in the United States, is the frequentist-style confidence interval. Confidence intervals were originally developed by Jerzy Neyman in his 1937 paper "Outline of a Theory of Statistical Estimation Based on the Classical Theory of Probability." This is the same Jerzy Neyman that worked with Egon Pearson earlier in the 1930's to develop the theory behind frequentist-style hypothesis testing. $^4$ 

When it comes to confidence intervals, Neyman recommends a three step procedure: 1. collect a sample, 2. create the interval (using methodology laid out in the paper) and 3. claim the value of the parameter is in the interval.

<br>
He goes on to say (and try to make sense of this):

> The justification of this recommendation lies in the fact that the three steps
described are equivalent to a random experiment which may result either in a correct
or in an erroneous statement concerning the value of [the parameter], the probability of a correct
statement being equal to [our confidence level]. Thus the statistician following the above recommendation
is in a position comparable with that of a game of chance with the
probability of winning being equal to [our confidence level].$^5$

And so, according to Neyman, we do our study, create our interval, and claim the parameter is contained in the interval. The probability we "win," or that our claim is correct, is equal to our confidence level. And so the problem of coherently quantifying the uncertainty involved with estimating a parameter is solved... right? __Nope.__

Unfortunately, Neyman is a master of subtle convolution that leads to technically valid statements but a terribly misled reader. The first 10 times you read the above passage, unless you are a well-trained statistician, you are (probably) not correctly interpreting the subtleties employed by Neyman.

The natural interpretation of the above passage--that we can create a confidence interval, make the claim that our interval contains the parameter, and be correct with X% probability is __NOT__ what the above passage says. We will get to the correct interpretation a bit later.

The issues with the above passage is a microcosm of all the problems with confidence intervals. They are difficult to (correctly) understand, it is natural and easy to misinterpret them--but--they are technically valid mathematically. Further, it is often inconsequential to misinterpet them in the way we are naturally inclined to do. This has led to extremely widespread misuse and misinterpretation even by those who use confidence intervals professionally.


# Frequentist Probabilities

To get to the bottom of what exactly a confidence interval is, we must first discuss frequentist probabilities--to which confidence intervals are inextricably tied. Frequentist style statistics defines the probability of an event as the relative frequency of that event as the number of trials (or times the event _could_ have occured) tends towards infinity. To make a probabilistic claim, it must be set up in the context of theoretically repeated trials. This is the definition typically used in an introductory statistics class--whether students (or even the teacher!) knows it.

For example, suppose we are interested in fair coin flips. The probability of a heads is equal to the limit of the ratio of flips that land heads-up to total flips, as the number of flips tends toward infinity. For a genuinely fair coin, this would be 1/2 (*why is that true?*). Notice this is a theoretical probability--and no actual coin flipping was required!

Now, say, we actually flipped a coin once. What is the probability the coin that now lays stationary on the ground is heads? Well, now, in __regards to that particular coin__ there are no trials to repeat. There is no randomness involved whatsoever with a coin that lays flat on the ground, and so our concept of frequentist probabilities simply __does not apply to this scenario__. 

The key takeaway here is that under the frequentist framework, __the probability of an event is inextricably tied to a trial that can be repeated indefinitely__. The probability of a fair coin landing on heads __only makes sense in the context of repeated coin flips.__


# The Confidence Interval

Now that we have an understanding of (frequentist-style) probability, we can define a confidence interval.


### Definition (Confidence Interval): 

> An X% confidence interval for [a parameter] is an interval (L,U) generated
by a procedure that in repeated sampling has an X% probability
of containing the true value of [the parameter] (Neyman, 1937).$^5$

This definition leads to some natural questions:

* Is the probability associated with __a procedure under repeated sampling__ scientifically relevant? 

* What is meant by repeated sampling? Two samples? Infinite samples?

* Do we have any level of certainty the parameter is in the all important one interval we actually computed?


### Back to the Quote:

Recall: Neymans recommendation is to 1. collect a sample, 2. create the interval (using his methodology) and 3. claim the value of the parameter is in the interval.

> The justification of this recommendation lies in the fact that the three steps
described are equivalent to a random experiment which may result either in a correct
or in an erroneous statement concerning the value of [the parameter], the probability of a correct
statement being equal to [our confidence level]. Thus the statistician following the above recommendation
is in a position comparable with that of a game of chance with the
probability of winning being equal to [our confidence level].


What Neyman is doing above, which we may not have noticed the first time we read his statement, is bundling all three of his recommended steps into __one trial__. Thus when we talk about the probability of a correct statement (the claim that the interval brackets the parameter), we are talking about the limiting frequency of correct statements to total statements as the number of trials (the bundle of three steps) tends towards infinity. __Neyman is not making a claim about any one particular confidence interval, but rather the process of creating one.__

So we can say the probability an interval (not __our__ interval) brackets the parameter is equal to our confidence level (usually .95). This is because, as determined by the procedure in step 2 of our Neyman's recommendations, the ratio of the number of correct statements to total statements is equal to our confidence level as the total number of statements tends towards infinity. And just like in the coin tossing example, after the interval is created, there is no longer a random process we can take the limit of. __After an interval is created, we cannot apply a probabilistic framework to it--nothing is random anymore.__

# But what does it all mean?!?

__Is the probability associated with _a procedure under repeated sampling_ scientifically relevant? Do we have any level of certainty the parameter is in all important one interval we actually computed?__

Individual confidence intervals, in general, have no good theoretical properties attached to them. We have no known level of certainty that our interval contains the parameter of interest. This is known as the problem of the single case. If you want a range of values and a level of certainty the parameter is amongst them, a frequentist style confidence interval is the wrong tool. (Add fishers response to this problem)

__What is meant by repeated sampling? Two samples? Infinite samples?__

We could be wrong with our first interval, and second interval, but how long until we are right approximately 95% of the time? This is a question about the convergence rate of our coverage probability. Quite frankly I don't know the answer to it. It's a great question though :)


__So are confidence intervals useless?__

Sometimes, but we can also use our imagination to envision one possible scenario where confidence intervals can play an important and meaningful role. Let's pretend you are a member of a government regulatory agency tasked with regularly assessing the value of a parameter and making regulatory decisions based on your assessment. Perhaps you're a member of the EPA examining toxicity levels or estimating maximum sustainable fish harvest levels to regulate the fishing industry. If you base your analysis on a correctly produced 95% frequentist style confidence interval, you can confidently say you are "right" in your assessment about 95% of the time in the long run. So in the context of repeatedly making decisions, you have theory-based assurances that you are getting it right about 95% of the time.


# Conclusion

If, as part of your research, you are making the request: 

> "Give me an interval that will bracket the true value of the parameter in 100p% of the instances of an experiment that is repeated a large number of times."

Then a frequentist style confidence interval is the appropriate solution to that request. Arguably, however, that is not in-line with what many (most) researchers are seeking when it comes to estimating parameters.

An alternative to frequentist confidence intervals that may be more appealing in the single-case scenario is the Bayesian credible interval:

>"The credible interval is an answer to the request: "Give me an interval that brackets the true value with probability p given the particular sample I've actually observed."

But that begs the questions: What are bayesian probabilities? And why are they relevant in our scientific context?

 * Under what circumstances, if any, does it make sense to follow the convention of fixing probability of Type I error and maximizing power subject to that constraint?
 * Under what circumstances, if any, is a confidence interval a "reasonable range of values" for an unknown parameter?
 * Why was the word "confidence" introduced into statistical practice? What does it convey that "probability" does not?

Quora 2:

> I think the fundamental problem is that frequentist statistics can only assign a probability to something that can have a long run frequency. Whether the true value of a parameter lies in a particular interval or not doesn't have a long run frequency, becuase we can only perform the experiment once, so you can't assign a frequentist probability to it. The problem arises from the definition of a probability. If you change the definition of a probability to a Bayesian one, then the problem instantly dissapears as you are no longer tied to discussion of long run frequencies.

> See my (rather tounge in cheek) answer to a related question here:

> "A Frequentist is someone that believes probabilies represent long run frequencies with which events ocurr; if needs be, he will invent a fictitious population from which your particular situation could be considered a random sample so that he can meaningfully talk about long run frequencies. If you ask him a question about a particular situation, he will not give a direct answer, but instead make a statement about this (possibly imaginary) population."

> In the case of a confidence interval, the question we normally would like to ask (unless we have a problem in quality control for example) is "given this sample of data, return the smallest interval that contains the true value of the parameter with probability X". However a frequentist can't do this as the experiment is only performed once and so there are no long run frequencies that can be used to assign a probability. So instead the frequentist has to invent a population of experiments (that you didn't perform) from which the experiment you did perform can be considered a random sample. The frequentist then gives you an indirect answer about that fictitious population of experiments, rather than a direct answer to the question you really wanted to ask about a particular experiment.
> Essentially it is a problem of language, the frequentist definition of a popuation simply doesn't allow discussion of the probability of the true value of a parameter lying in a particular interval. That doesn't mean frequentist statistics are bad, or not useful, but it is important to know the limitations.


Stat stack exchange:

>I think the premise of this question is flawed because it denies the distinction between the uncertain and the known.

> Describing a coin flip provides a good analogy. Before the coin is flipped, the outcome is uncertain; afterwards, it is no longer "hypothetical." Confusing this fait accompli with the actual situation we wish to understand (the behavior of the coin, or decisions that are to be made as a result of its outcome) essentially denies a role for probability in understanding the world.

> This contrast is thrown in sharp relief within an experimental or regulatory arena. In such cases the scientist or the regulator know they will be faced with situations whose outcomes, at any time beforehand, are unknown, yet they must make important determinations such as how to design the experiment or establish the criteria to use in determining compliance with regulations (for drug testing, workplace safety, environmental standards, and so on). These people and the institutions for which they work need methods and knowledge of the probabilistic characteristics of those methods in order to develop optimal and defensible strategies, such as good experimental designs and fair decision procedures that err as little as possible.

> Confidence intervals, despite their classically poor justification, fit into this decision-theoretic framework. When a method of constructing a random interval has a combination of good properties, such as assuring a minimal expected coverage of the interval and minimizing the expected length of the interval--both of them a priori properties, not a posteriori ones--then over a long career of using that method we can minimize the costs associated with the actions that are indicated by that method.
