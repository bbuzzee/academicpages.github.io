# Background

Beyond meat IPOed May 2nd 2019 at around 25 dollars a share. As of June 7th 2019, it stands at 134 dollars per share. Reputable sources, such as r/wsb, suggest that they are a tiny company in a super competitive market with extremely narrow margins and don't deserve the trip to the moon they are currently on. Other's believe their product is a game changer in the food industry and their business deserves their current valuation.

I believe we may be witnessing a self-reinforcing feedback loop where investor psychology and market structure are combining forces to send BYND's price to the moon. Many observing this upward momentum are looking for an opportunity to get aboard this rocketship. I, on the other hand, am more interested in if/when this ship runs out of fuel and comes crashing back down to earth. I believe I'm definitiley too late to the game to profit off of upward moves, but I have some time to sort out whether or not there's enough fuel in the ship to escape earths gravity. I will use this post to document my analysis and reasoning so that I can reference it in the future.


# Strategy


### Valuation
  * Compute a reasonable valuation of Beyond Meat
  * Compare my valuation to  other's valuations and most importantly the current price
  * If BYND is a bubble, it's price should be much higher than any reasonable valuation. If there isn't a BIG gap between price and value, stop here.

### Understand the market forces at play
  * Construct a template of how similar scenarios have played out in the past (TLRY).
  * Take into account low float, short squeezes, liquidity issues
  * Try to understand plausible behavioral and structural theories for price movements. Why did it go up? Why will it go down?
  
### Timing and Position
  * Wait patiently for a catalyst that turns momentum and creates a downward self-reinforcing feedback loop, potentially waiting months (earnings report, competition annnouncement, etc). I won't be predicting the downfall, but rather recognizing it after it begins.
  * What have been catalysts similar scenarios in the past? How much of a decline counts as a change in momentum?
  * Enter an intelligent short position (probably puts), making sure I understand enough about my position that I don't lose money even if I'm right. I.e. are the premiums on the puts reasonable?
  * Note: prices for options may only become reasonable months after the catalyst/shift in momentum occurs. It's critical to refer back to the valuation to determine how far the fall will be.

# Valuation

Due to a lack of data, perhaps the best valuation of the company was performed by the company itself. On May 2nd, 2019, the company determined the fair value of it's IPO shares to be $25/share, or the total value of the company to be about 1.5 billion dollars.

In April of 2019 it was valued at 20/share, October 2018 at 17/share, and May 2018 a 3/share. These were the per share rates employees common stock options were executed at.

It is worth noting that all of these valuations could be overstating the company's value, since it was performed by the company itself.
