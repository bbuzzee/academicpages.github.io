This post is inspired by the [Global Village Construction Set.](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/). The main idea put forth by the GVCS project is that an entire village can be created and maintained by just a handful of cheap, modular, and open-source pieces of machinery. This project focuses on the __physical__ components required by a small group of people to survive. Contemplating this project led me to a simple thought experiment: Suppose a small village were starting from absolute square one and were given all the physical tools they could possibly need. What would separate a successful village--one that not only survives but makes technological and cultural progress--from one that fails and either collapses or stagnates?

Now, this is a loaded question with no real answer, but I would argue there is another set of cheap, multi-use tools required by any society to genuinely thrive--__the tools required to observe truth in the world.__

The world is at war with truth. From government sanction misinformation campaigns, to opinion news broadcasts dedicated to triggering emotional responses from viewers, to the proliferation of demagoguery in politics, mistruths are everywhere--and people do not have the tools to fight it.
