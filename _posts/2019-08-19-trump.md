This post aggregates __public__ comments about the character of Donald Trump, by people that Donald Trump personally hired. The character of many of the sources is questionable.

  
### Mick Mulvaney, White House Chief of Staff, December 2018 - TBD
  
> Yes, I am supporting Donald Trump, but I'm doing so as enthusiastically as I can,
  given the fact that I think he's a terrible human being. But the choice on the other side is just as bad" [Source 1](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/15/mulvaney-trump-terrible-human-being-1066657)


### Michael Cohen, Former Vice President of The Trump Organization and Personal Attorney for Donald Trump, 2006-2018

> I am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for
them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York.
I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty - of the things I did
for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him.
I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump's illicit acts
rather than listening to my own conscience.
I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is.
He is a racist.
He is a conman.
He is a cheat. [Source 2](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/27/696752450/michael-cohen-to-testify-publicly-before-congress-on-alleged-trump-lawbreaking)


### Anthony Scaramucci, White House Director of Communications, July 21 to July 31, 2017

> Okay, the guy's unstable, everyone inside knows it, everyone outside knows it-let's see if we can find a viable alternative [Source 3](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457923-scaramucci-assembling-team-of-former-cabinet-members-to-speak-out)

>  He treats everybody like objects. There's no way he's a racist because when he's looking at you he doesn't see color, he just sees a potential transaction, an opportunity or a detriment. That's not racism. That might be narcissism. I'm not a psychiatrist so I don't know but it's not racism because I've watched him do it. It's like a worse level than racism. It's racist against everybody. he could careless. you're an object in his way for or against and then he's got a playbook. He's using it on me now.

### John Kelly, White House Chief of Staff, July 2017 to December 2018

> When I first took over, he was inclined to want to withdraw from Afghanistan... He was frustrated. It was a huge decision to make ... and frankly there was no system at all for a lot of reasons - palace intrigue and the rest of it - when I got there."

> In the phone interview Friday, Kelly defended his rocky tenure, arguing that it is best measured by what the president did not do when Kelly was at his side. (Indirect Quote) [Source 6](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-john-kelly-exit-interview-20181230-story.html)


### James Mattis, Secretary of Defense, January 2017 to January 2019

> One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships.

> Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.

> Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. [Source 7](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/20/politics/james-mattis-resignation-letter-doc/index.html)
