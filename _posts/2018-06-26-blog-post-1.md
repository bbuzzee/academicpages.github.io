# Reproducible Research

For conclusions from a scientific study to be trustworthy, they must be verifiable. All too often, however, the conclusions of scientific studies cannot be verified because the data are not available, the methods are not fully described, or the software researchers used is inaccessible. The goal of the reproducible research movement is to conduct and document research in a manner that allows third parties to fully replicate the results of a study. This allows researchers not involved in the original study to fully understand the methods used and verify the correctness of any conclusions. This blog post will focus on statistical reproducibility and breaks down a reproducible research project into 4 main components that are independent of any type of analysis software.


# Components of Reproducible Research


## 1. The Data

Raw data is the starting point of any statistical analysis and is essential to verifying statistical results from beginning to end. Often, however, the raw data is messy, meaning it is not in a form that can be easily analyzed. As such, the first task in a statistical analysis is often converting the raw dataset into a "tidy" one. A "tidy" dataset is a dataset of a particular form that makes analysis and visualizations relatively easy and straightforward. According to Wickham (2014), a tidy dataset is one where:

* Each column corresponds to one variable
* Each row represents one observational unit
* Data from different types of observational units are stored in different data tables

When converting the raw data to a tidy dataset, it is important not to overwrite the original 'messy' dataset. Both the raw data and the clean data should be saved as separate files. Sometimes mistakes are made when converting the raw data to a useable format, and without the raw data, this cannot be checked for. Other researchers may also choose to process the raw data in a different manner, which requires the original raw data be kept intact.

## 2. The Code

The code used to conduct an analysis represents a complete description of all calculations and data manipulations. Without the code, a researcher would have to rely on general descriptions of calculations and will rarely know exactly how the analysis was performed. Saving the code and using relative file paths allows a third party to simply download the data and code and immediately run the analysis for themselves. For example, the script used to convert the raw data to a tidy dataset should be saved so that anyone can download the raw data and cleaning script and then be able to recreate the tidy dataset from scratch on their own computer.

## 3. Documentation

A dataset without a description of what the variables represent or how the data were collected is useless to those not involved in its creation. Similarly, code that cannot be human-read or followed is of little help when it comes to understanding or verifying an analysis. Both the data and the code used must be well documented in order for a statistical analysis to be reproducible.

Data should always be accompanied by "metadata." Metadata is a complete description of the data--the who, what, where, when, why, and how behind the data. The metadata file should allow parties not involved in the study or data collection process to fully understand what everything in the raw data file represents and how it got there. The metadata should fully explain or provide a link to a full explanation of the sampling or experimental protocols used to collect the data. Creating and saving a metadata file with your dataset also makes it possible for the data to be reused for other purposes beyond the original intentions, even after long periods of time have passed.

In addition to documenting the data, the code itself must be documented. Code should be well commented and written in a manner that is conducive to human reading. Custom functions should be accompanied by appropriate descriptions and instructions. Writing readable code makes the code less prone to error, easier to understand, easier to debug and improve, and makes collaboration a smoother process. A reader should be able to open a script without any prior knowledge of it and be able to attain a general understanding of what the code does and how it does it in a reasonably short amount of time. See http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html for a simple guide to writing readable R code.


For highly technical code, it may be better to write the code in an Rmarkdown or Notebook type document. Rmarkdown and Notebook documents allow code and output to be interwoven with well-formatted sections of text. This can significantly improve the readability of technical documents and allows for (and even encourages) explanations to be more thorough.

## 4. Organization and Accessibility

In order to be useful, all of the above components need to be organized and accessible. Ideally, any individual wishing to reproduce the results of a particular study should be able to quickly find the data and code used for that study in an archive or repository, and then immediately be able to identify the purpose and location of all the major project components.

When dealing with computational projects, file clutter can slow down workflows and even render an entire project inaccessible to others. The problem of clutter can be solved by structuring a project directory in a clear and well-organized manner. The exact structure of a directory is arbitrary and will vary from project to project, but a few things should be common to all project directories: 1. the directory should contain everything needed to reproduce the analysis--including the data, code, and final product(s) 2. folders should be used to group similar files and make finding files a straightforward process 3. folders and files should be named in a manner that clearly indicates their contents. The following is an example of a simple directory structure for an R project, to which additional folders can be added as needed. (/ indicates a folder) 

 * /Project
    * /Rscripts
    * /data
    * /reports
    * project.Rproj


Finally, to make a project accessible to everyone, it needs to be hosted online. Options range from formal dedicated archives to simple GitHub repositories. Regardless of where the project is stored, it needs to have an informative name, be tagged with appropriate keywords, and be searchable so that others can find it.


## Implementation

There are many options available that can be used to piece together the above components. Software will continually change, but putting together code, data, and documentation in a coherent and accessible way will be the hallmark of good science for a long time to come.
